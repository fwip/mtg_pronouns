  <h2> What's this about? </h2>
  <p> To investigate the suitability of singular "they" in the card game <b>Magic: The Gathering</b> </p>

  <h2> Huh? </h2>
  <p> Well, <b>Magic</b> cards use the awkward "he or she" construct anytime they need to refer to a player.
  Some players are not accurately described by "he or she," preferring another pronoun or none at all.
  Also, some cards sound really clunky:
  <blockquote>"If a player would draw a card except the first one he or she draws in his or her draw step each turn, that player discards a card instead. If the player discards a card this way, he or she draws a card. If the player doesn't discard a card this way, he or she puts the top card of his or her library into his or her graveyard."</blockquote>
  That's six instances of "he or she" or "his or her" in three sentences! </p>

  <h2> So... </h2>
  <p> So, I made a <a href="http://github.com/Fwip/mtg_pronouns">simple ruby project</a> that auto-replaces "he or she" with "they" and "his or her" with "their." </p>

  <h2> I wanna see! </h2>
  <p> Sweet. <a href="reworded_cards.md">Plaintext</a> or <a href="reworded_cards.html">Card mockups?</a></p>
