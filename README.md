# An experiment with MTG and pronouns

There's been a bit of discussion regarding "his or her" vs. "their" in rules text of Magic: The Gathering cards. This project is intended to check out the feasibility of a straightforward replacement.

## Current Replacements


* 'He or she' -> 'They'
* 'His or her' -> 'Their'

## How to help

File any issues / enhancement requests on the issue tracker. If you're ambitious, submit a pull request.

If you're more patient, read through the list of translated cards, and let me know if there are any that are legitimately confusing.
